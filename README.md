# MUP-DESIGNPROJECT

Problem Statement:-
An Intelligent Humidistat

A humidistat is supposed to be reset according to the outside temperature â€“ as the
outside temperature falls, the humidity level inside the house should be set lower.
The purpose of this project is to develop a humidistat which senses the outside
temperature and adjusts the humidity accordingly. Two sensors are required:
outside temperature and inside humidity. Output is provided via a simple relay
with the humidifier (presumably on the furnace) being on or off. Also, readings
from the humidity and temperature sensors must be displayed on an LCD display.
The entire system can be turned on or off using a single switch.
